# **Realisation of a Web Application for the Functionality of the Dijkstra Algorithm Considering Didactic Aspects**

## **Introduction**
This project is part of my bachelor thesis at the university, where a web application was developed to demonstrate the Dijkstra algorithm. The focus is on a didactic, playful presentation to make the functionality of the algorithm understandable.

## **Main Features**
- **Predefined Graphs:** Choose from a variety of predefined graphs to test the algorithm.
- **Random Graphs:** Generate random graphs for diverse scenarios.
- **Custom Graphs:** Create your own graphs by adding nodes and edges manually.
- **Connect Nodes:** Manually connect nodes to design custom graphs.
- **Start Game:** Calculate the shortest path in the current graph.
- **Save and Load:** Save graphs and load them later to continue or share your work.

## **Usage**
1. **Launch:** Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. **Select Graph:** Choose a predefined or create a new graph.
3. **Interact:** Connect nodes and start the algorithm.
4. **Results:** View the shortest path calculation and display.
5. Enjoy exploring the Dijkstra algorithm!
