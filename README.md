Realisation of a web application for the functionality of the Dijkstra algorithm under consideration of didactic aspects
Introduction
This is a project as part of my bachelor thesis at the university, in which a web application was developed to demonstrate the Dijkstra algorithm. The focus is on the didactic, playful presentation in order to make the functionality of the algorithm understandable.
Main Features
Predefined Graphs: Choose from a variety of predefined graphs to test the algorithm.
Random Graphs: Generate random graphs for diverse scenarios.
Custom Graphs: Create your own graphs by adding nodes and edges manually.
Connect Nodes: Manually connect nodes to design custom graphs.
Start Game: Calculate the shortest path in the current graph.
Save and Load: Save graphs and load them later to continue or share your work.
Usage
Launch: Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Select Graph: Choose a predefined or create a new graph.
Interact: Connect nodes and start the algorithm.
Results: View the shortest path calculation and display.
Enjoy exploring the Dijkstra algorithm!
