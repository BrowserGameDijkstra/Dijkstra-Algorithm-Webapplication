# **Realisation of a Web Application for the Functionality of the Dijkstra Algorithm Considering Didactic Aspects**

## **Introduction**
This project is part of my bachelor thesis at the university, where a web application was developed to demonstrate the Dijkstra algorithm. The focus is on a didactic, playful presentation to make the functionality of the algorithm understandable.

## **Main Features**
- **Predefined Graphs:** Choose from a variety of predefined graphs to test the algorithm.
- **Random Graphs:** Generate random graphs for diverse scenarios.
- **Custom Graphs:** Create your own graphs by adding nodes and edges manually.
- **Connect Nodes:** Manually connect nodes to design custom graphs.
- **Start Game:** Calculate the shortest path in the current graph.
- **Save and Load:** Save graphs and load them later to continue or share your work.

## **Usage**
1. **Launch:** Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. **Select Graph:** Choose a predefined or create a new graph.
3. **Interact:** Connect nodes and start the algorithm.
4. **Results:** View the shortest path calculation and display.
5. Enjoy exploring the Dijkstra algorithm!

# Realisation of a Web Application for the Functionality of the Dijkstra Algorithm under Consideration of Didactic Aspects

## Introduction
This project, developed as part of my bachelor thesis at the university, presents a web application designed to demonstrate the Dijkstra algorithm. The primary focus is on providing a didactic and engaging presentation to make the algorithm's functionality easily understandable.

## Main Features
- **Predefined Graphs**: Choose from a variety of carefully designed, predefined graphs to test the algorithm and explore its behavior.
- **Random Graphs**: Generate random graphs on the fly to experiment with diverse scenarios and edge cases.
- **Custom Graphs**: Unleash your creativity by creating your own graphs from scratch. Add nodes and edges manually to build unique graph structures.
- **Connect Nodes**: Easily connect nodes with a simple click-and-drag interface to design custom graphs effortlessly.
- **Start Game**: Put your graph to the test! Calculate the shortest path between nodes and watch the algorithm in action.
- **Save and Load**: Save your crafted graphs for later use and share them with others. Load previously saved graphs to continue your work or explore shared creations.

## Usage
1. **Launch**: To get started, simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.
2. **Select Graph**: Choose from the available predefined graphs or dive right in and create your own custom graph.
3. **Interact**: Connect nodes by clicking and dragging. Customize your graph to your heart's content.
4. **Start Game**: When you're ready, click the "Start Game" button to witness the Dijkstra algorithm calculate the shortest path in your graph.
5. **View Results**: Marvel at the visual display of the shortest path calculation and gain a deeper understanding of the algorithm's inner workings.

Enjoy exploring the fascinating world of the Dijkstra algorithm!
