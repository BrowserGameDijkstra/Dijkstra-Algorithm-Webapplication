Dijkstra algorithm web browser game
This index.html file contains an interactive web browser application that illustrates the Dijkstra algorithm for calculating the shortest path in a graph. This application allows users to explore different graphs and understand the algorithm.
Main functions
Pre-built graphs: The application offers a selection of ready-made graphs that can be loaded and analyzed directly.
1
Random graphs: Users can have randomly generated graphs created to test the algorithm with different structures.
1
Design your own graphs: The application allows users to create and edit their own graphs.
1
Connect nodes: Users can connect nodes in the graph and define the distances between them.
1
Visualize Dijkstra's algorithm: Once a graph has been created, Dijkstra's algorithm can be started to find the shortest path between the nodes. The process is visualized step by step.

The game
Choose a ready-made graph, create a random graph or design your own graph.
Connect the nodes in the graph and define the distances.
Start the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path between the nodes.
Follow the execution of the algorithm and observe how it determines the shortest path.
Experiment with different graphs and node configurations to develop a better understanding of the algorithm.
The application also offers help functions and the option to save and load graphs. Dive into the world of graph theory and discover the power of Dijkstra's algorithm with this interactive web browser application!
