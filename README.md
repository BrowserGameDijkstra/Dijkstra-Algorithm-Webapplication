Introduction
This project is a web application that demonstrates the Dijkstra algorithm. It focuses on a didactic, playful presentation to make the algorithm understandable.
Main Features
Predefined Graphs: Choose from a variety of predefined graphs to test the algorithm.
Random Graphs: Generate random graphs for diverse scenarios.
Custom Graphs: Create your own graphs by adding nodes and edges manually.
Connect Nodes: Manually connect nodes to design custom graphs.
Start Game: Calculate the shortest path in the current graph.
Save and Load: Save graphs and load them later to continue or share your work.
Usage
Launch: Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Select Graph: Choose a predefined or create a new graph.
Interact: Connect nodes and start the algorithm.
Results: View the shortest path calculation and display.
Enjoy exploring the Dijkstra algorithm!
